 *
 * @brief Class that provides meta-data properties compliant with
 *  a subset of MODS Version 3.4. We only support those sub-elements
 *  we have use-cases (and data) for. We map elements and attributes
 *  from the original XML standard to 'element/subelement[@attribute="..."]'
 *  property names.
 *
 *  MODS allows most elements, especially top-level elements to be repeated.
 *  We do not implement that full flexibility as we only require repeated
 *  elements for translation. This allows us to avoid the considerable extra
 *  overhead of handling composite elements in most cases. We essentially
 *  translate MODS into a flat key-value list wherever possible. The most
 *  notable exception to this rule is the name element which is implemented
 *  as a composite. Additional composites can be introduced later if required.
 *
 *  See <http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/mods-outline.html>.
 *
 *  Wherever possible we follow the "Digital Library Federation / Aquifer
 *  Implementation Guidelines for Shareable MODS Records", see
 *  <https://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence/download/attachments/24288/DLFMODS_ImplementationGuidelines.pdf>
 *
 *  NB: This class is an application agnostic base class to be extended
 *  by application specific versions of the schema configuring this class
 *  via constructor arguments.

		// titleInfo
		//

		// Titles are an extremely important access point for digital library
		// resources, and are frequently used in brief record displays to assist
		// end users in deciding whether to investigate a resource further. As
		// such, at least one titleInfo description with at least one title
		// statement is required. Additional titleInfo descriptions should be used to
		// indicate other titles for the resource. Do not include punctuation
		// intended to delineate parts of titles separated into various statements
		// within the titleInfo description.

		// We do not implement titleInfo[@type] as we do not allow repetition of the
		// titleInfo element. We assume that our titles are always primary titles of
		// the resource.

		// The nonSort element contains characters, including initial articles, punctuation, and
		// spaces that appear at the beginning of a title that should be ignored for indexing of titles.
		// This element must be used when non-sorting characters are present, rather than including
		// them in the text of the title element.

		// The DLF/Aquifer Implementation Guidelines for Shareable MODS Records require the

		// for sorting and similar features, we mark the publication date (dateIssued) as a
		// key date using the keyDate="yes" attribute. You may choose to use only one date

		//
		// Information in subject describes subject content represented in or by the work, and
		// typically answers such questions as who, what, where, and when.
		// Whether or not the use of subject is applicable depends upon who might search for an
		// item outside its local context and how they are likely to search for it. For instance, topical

		// to be interested in the form or genre of an item, and not its subject content, using the
		// genre element (not the subelement under subject) may be most appropriate.
		//
		// However, in many instances, using appropriate subject values can greatly enhance
		// users’ ability to locate relevant works. Enter as many specific terms as necessary to
		// capture subject content, and be consistent in the formatting of subject terms.
		//
		// It is highly recommended that subject terms come from a controlled vocabulary or formal
		// classification scheme and that this source is identified in the authority attribute. Select
		// controlled vocabularies that are most relevant to and frequently used by the communities
