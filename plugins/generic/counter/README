	=================================
	=== COUNTER Statistics Plugin
	=================================


The COUNTER statistics plugin generates Counter reports on journal usage
(see http://www.projectcounter.org). Currently, Journal Report 1a is
supported; additional reports will be included in later releases.

This plugin must be enabled in order to function; see the Journal Manager's
"System Plugins".

When enabled, the plugin adds a "COUNTER Statistics" link to the Journal
Manager's "Management Pages" list.

This plugin ships with current releases of OJS 2.x and the PKP support
team may be contacted for more information. See docs/README.
