This document describes the config parameters that control the implicit authentication plugin in OJS. It does not describe how to set up Shibboleth based authentication.

In the [security] section of the config.inc.php file there are several parameters that affect the operation of the implicit auth plugin. They are all commented out - by default. They are shown here with their default settings like they are in the config file. When you enable implicit auth - you should uncomment all of these variables.

    implicit_auth = On

This setting turns on or off implicit authentication. If implicit_auth is not on - none of the other implicit_auth variables are consulted. The main effect of turning implicit_auth on - is that the login process goes through Shibboleth and several of the forms are modified so that they do not ask the user for name and address type information.

Implicit Auth Header Variables. These variables supply the name of the header variable that contains a specific value. The header variable values shown are from the Texas Digital Library's Shibboleth environment. For example -- the user's first name - will be in the header variable HTTP_TDL_GIVENNAME.

	implicit_auth_header_first_name = HTTP_TDL_GIVENNAME
	implicit_auth_header_last_name = HTTP_TDL_SN
	implicit_auth_header_email = HTTP_TDL_MAIL
	implicit_auth_header_phone = HTTP_TDL_TELEPHONENUMBER
	implicit_auth_header_initials = HTTP_TDL_METADATA_INITIALS
	implicit_auth_header_mailing_address = HTTP_TDL_METADATA_TDLHOMEPOSTALADDRESS
	implicit_auth_header_uin = HTTP_TDL_TDLUID
    
The UIN is the user's primary identification number. While some of the other information may change (like a person's last name) - the UIN is pretty much guaranteed to stay the same through time. The UIN is used to look up a user's record when they authenticate.

The implicit_auth_admin_list is a blank delimited list of UINs that should be set up as an admin user. When a user logs in - if their UIN is in this list then they are made an admin user. This list is checked every time a user logs in and if they are not in the list - then their admin privilege is revoked.

    implicit_auth_admin_list = "ou812@tdl.org 65B7FA8F2DAA90F7@utexas.edu joeuser@tdl.org"

The implicit_auth_wayf_url is the URL of the Shibboleth Wayfinder page. This is set up in the Shibboleth configuration.

    implicit_auth_wayf_url = "/Shibboleth.sso/wayf" 
    
One additional operational note is that when authenticating a user, if they are not found by their UIN - we make an additional check to see if they can be found by their email address. If so - we update the UIN field in their user record and log them in. This provides a stratiforward way to migrate existing users in the users table to the system with implicit authentication.
