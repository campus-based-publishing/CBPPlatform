 *
 * @brief Operations for retrieving and modifying process data.
 *
 * Parallel processes are pooled. This defines a given number
 * of process slots per pool. Once these slots are occupied, no
 * new processes can be spawned for a given process type.
 *
 * The process ID is not an integer but a globally unique string
 * identifier that has to fulfill the following additional functions:
 * 1) It is used as a one-time-key to authorize the the web
 *    request spawning a new process. It therefore has to be
 *    random enough to avoid it being guessed by an outsider.
 * 2) We also use the process ID as a unique token to implement
 *    an atomic locking strategy to avoid race conditions when
 *    executing processes in parallel.
 *
 * We use the uniqid() method to genereate one-time keys. This is not
 * really cryptographically secure but it probably makes it difficult
 * enough to guess the key to avoid abuse.
 * This assumes that we don't start using processes for more sensitive
 * tasks. If that happens we'd need to improve the randomness of the
 * process id (e.g. via /dev/urandom or similar).
 *
 * This usage of the processes table also explains why there is no
 * updateObject() method in this DAO. If you need a process with different
 * characteristics then insert a new one and delete stale processes.

// stamp of more than 15 minutes ago. Running processes should check
// regularly (about once per minute) whether "their" process entry
// is still their. If not they are required to halt immediately.
// NB: Don't set this timeout much shorter as this may
// potentially cause more parallel processes being spawned
// than allowed.
