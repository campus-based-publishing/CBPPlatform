About
-----
This plugin for OJS 2 provides an import/export plugin to generate bibliographic information for articles in the current issue in PubMed standard publisher data format XML for indexing in NLM PubMed/MEDLINE.  Details on the XML format and data requirements is available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/spec.html

License
-------
This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file COPYING for the complete terms of this license.

System Requirements
-------------------
Same requirements as the OJS 2.1.x core.

Installation
------------
To install the plugin:
 - copy the pubmed folder into OJS/plugins/importexport

The export functionality can then be accessed through: 
 - Home > User > Journal Management > Import/Export Data > PubMed XML Export Plugin

Known Issues/Limitations
---------
- the <Replaces/> tag is not used as OJS does not contain PMID metadata
- because of ambiguity in the pagination functionality in OJS, <FirstPage/> and <LastPage/> tags may potentially be generated incorrectly
- article IDs are limited to internal ("pii") identifiers; DOIs are not handled because of limitations in the current version of OJS (including forward-slash escaping)

Localization
------------
Localized titles are determined from the per-article language setting, rather than the journal locale.  As such, localized bibliographic data should be handled properly as per the PubMed data format guidelines, however, it has not been explicitly tested as of this release.
