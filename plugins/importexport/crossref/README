About
-----
This plugin for OJS 2 provides an import/export plugin to generate metadata information for articles 
and issues for indexing in CrossRef.  Details on the XML format and data requirements is available at: 
http://www.crossref.org/schema

License
-------
This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file COPYING for the 
complete terms of this license.

System Requirements
-------------------
Same requirements as the OJS 2.x core.

Installation
------------
To install the plugin:
 - copy the crossref folder into OJS/plugins/importexport

The export functionality can then be accessed through: 
 - Home > User > Journal Management > Import/Export Data > CrossRef XML Export Plugin

Known Issues/Limitations
---------
The handling of a DOI suffix is currently hardcoded into the plugin and any changes have to be made 
by editing the code.  Until such a time when DOI's are part of the OJS core this is seen as the 
quick and dirty solution.  Once DOIs are handled by the core then this plugin should be updated to 
reflect as much.

Localization
------------
Localized titles are determined from the per-article language setting, rather than the journal locale.  
As such, localized bibliographic data should be handled properly as per the CrossRef data format 
guidelines, however, it has not been explicitly tested as of this release.
