	=== Resolver Gateway Plugin
	=================================


The Resolver gateway plugin resolves individual articles in the OJS
installation using the supplied bibliographic information. It can be addressed
at the following URL pattern:

http://localhost/ojs2/index.php/myJournal/gateway/plugin/ResolverPlugin/...

...where, of course, localhost is the local server name, ojs2 is the path
to the OJS 2.x installation, and myJournal is the path to a particular
journal.

The plugin must be enabled in order to respond to requests. To enable the
plugin, or ensure that it is sufficiently configured, log into the Journal
Manager's "System Plugins" page, find the Resolver Gateway Plugin under the
"Gateway Plugins" heading, and click "Enable".

The resolver accepts parameters after the given URL pattern in the following
formats:

http://.../vnp/[volume]/[number]/[page]
http://.../ynp/[year]/[number]/[page]

...where [volume], [number], [year], and [page] are integers identifying the
issue and page number of the desired content. (Future releases will introduce
additional resolving methods in addition to "vnp" and "ynp".)

This plugin ships with current releases of OJS 2.x and the PKP support
team may be contacted for more information. See docs/README.
